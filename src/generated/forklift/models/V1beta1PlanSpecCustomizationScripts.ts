/**
 * CustomizationScripts references a ConfigMap containing customization scripts
to run during guest conversion. The ConfigMap must exist in the specified
namespace and contain script files with keys following these patterns:
  - Windows: [0-9]+_win_firstboot_[description_text].ps1
  - Linux: [0-9]+_linux_(run|firstboot)_[description_text].sh
Scripts are mounted at &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;dynamic_scripts in the conversion pod and
executed by virt-customize. The number at the start of the key determines the
execution order. If not specified, no custom scripts are injected.

the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
